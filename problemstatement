PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many organizations rely on manual or spreadsheet-based processes to track employee achievements and reward points, leading to delays, errors, and lack of transparency. Managers and HR struggle to monitor performance effectively, and employees often miss timely recognition. The proposed Employee Recognition & Rewards Tracker in Salesforce will centralize achievements, automate notifications, calculate reward points, and provide real-time dashboards to enhance engagement and motivation.
